# superTinyRenderer

This repo is a little exercise in building a suuuuper basic C++ renderer from scratch that can read a `.obj` file then output a `.bmp` image

### Milestones:
- [x] draw a gradient on a `.bmp` file
- [x] follow the drawing triangles chapter of the tutorial
- [x] finish the wireframe of a demon example
- [x] finish barycentric coordinates shading
- [] finish removing hidden faces chapter
- [x] refactor model code into an object

Notes:
- Apparently the new scale method is deleting some faces which is not good.
